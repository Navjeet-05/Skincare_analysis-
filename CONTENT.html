            <b> Key Steps in a Skincare Routine:</b> <br> <br>
            Understanding Your Skin Type:

The first step to building a good skincare routine is knowing your skin type. <br> <br>

~Normal: Balanced oil production. <br>
~Dry: Lacks oil, feels tight, and prone to flaky patches. <br>
~Oily: Overactive oil glands, shiny appearance, and frequent breakouts. <br>
~Combination: A mix of oily and dry areas, often with an oily T-zone. <br>
~Sensitive: Reacts easily to products or environmental factors, often with redness or irritation. <br> <br>
            1.Cleansing : Remove dirt, oil, and impurities from your skin using a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type . <br>
            2.Toning : Restore your skin's pH balance and tighten pores with a toner. <br>
            3.Moisturizing : Hydrate your skin to keep it supple and prevent dryness. Choose a moisturizer that complements your skin type. <br>
            4.Sunscreen : Protect your skin from harmful UV rays by applying sunscreen with a broad-spectrum SPF of 30 or higher daily. <br> <br>
